TODO

- fix bug in indexNode and loopNode:  crash when changing/deleting input connection (something to do with outputs changing)?
- fix typeView bug(s):
  - type T big.Int, e.g.,  shows up as the struct{} that big.Int is
  - browser shows unexported types
- handle funcs with an unconnected input whose type must be named to make a zero value (i.e., is ArrayType or StructType):  import package or, if it is an unexported type, complain and don't write files.
- stabilize order of imports (alphabetical).    Also nodes? pro: deterministic build, stable files; con: hides bugs  (option:  deterministic in .flux files, random in .go)
- prefix all names with "pkg." in .flux files, including names in current package.  then, .flux files don't change when moved between packages.  downside:  we would have to strip these prefixes when writing decl sources in importer.go
- color conns by type.  hash type name, interpret as color.  or, use multiple colors to describe the whole type tree (outlined, woven, etc).
- improve valueView editing; currently, name and type can't be edited separately.  solution:  allow to focus name text.
- fix connection drawing during mouse editing
- find a better way to embed font (current using something like https://github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata, https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/golang-nuts/UOIUyn7uFsY/Uescy-cI7hQJ) (best to wait for this https://code.google.com/p/go/issues/detail?id=3035)

before releasing:
- handle all errors
  - including reader.go parsing errors?
- gofmt


DONE

- automatic arrangment
- pretty blocks, nodes, conns
- funcs:  inputs, outputs
- types, methods
- loops
- allow package name to differ from directory name
