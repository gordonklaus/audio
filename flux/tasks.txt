TODO

- wireless connections
- shortcuts:
  - on an out port, press '.' to select a field or method
  - on an in port, press '{' to create a composite literal of the port's type
  - on a node or connection, press cmd-R(cmd-I?) to bring up a browser with funcs and ops suitable to insert, i.e., having a signature compatible with the existing node's connections
- don't automatically discard dead code (unconnected literals, unassigned index expressions, unconnected append(), ...); write them instead as assigment to the blank identifier.  add a command to remove dead code at the user's discretion.
- make connectionBundles to reduce wire clutter?  each port has at most one connectionBundle that branches off connections near each port it connects to.  or don't add a new object, just draw connections coincident that originate at the same port.  especially bundle coincident connections that cross block boundaries.
- GcImport yields parameter and result names like nameÂ·1, which is invalid in Go source.  fix go/types or strip these chars.
- fix bug in indexNode and loopNode:  crash when changing/deleting input connection (something to do with outputs changing)?  might have to do with trying to connect the input to the 2nd inputsNode output, which disappears before the connection is made.
- fix typeView bug(s):
  - type T big.Int, e.g.,  shows up as the struct{} that big.Int is
- hide unexported struct fields and interface methods in browser's typeView
- in browser, by default don't show non-Go dirs; toggle visibility with a key
- prefix names with pkg name in browser and typeView
- manage code flux:  names, signatures, types, etc.
  - update objects currently being edited
  - update known clients upon change (e.g., update callers when func sig changes)
  - handle changes during import and read.  (strip all func bodies in importer)
- handle funcs with an unconnected input whose type must be named to make a zero value (i.e., is ArrayType or StructType):  import package or, if it is an unexported type, complain and don't write files.
- stabilize file format so that textual diffs only show relevant changes:
  - order of imports (alphabetical).
  - node order? pro: deterministic build, stable files; con: hides bugs
  - variable names (also seqIDs)
- color conns by type.  hash type name, interpret as color.  or, use multiple colors to describe the whole type tree (outlined, woven, etc).
- improve valueView editing; currently, name and type can't be edited separately.  solution:  allow to focus name text.
- find a better way to embed font (current using something like https://github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata, https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/golang-nuts/UOIUyn7uFsY/Uescy-cI7hQJ) (best to wait for this https://code.google.com/p/go/issues/detail?id=3035).  Or consider installing it in a fixed location (OS X: in app bundle.  Linux: in /usr/share?  Windows: in application directory?)  Also check the go src directory in case someone has go-gotten flux?
- handle constant expressions:
  - write result to constant (not variable), or type may not propagate correctly
  - a node in a const expr should be collapsable to its value; in particular, this will be nice in typeView for array length
- multiple panes for editing multiple funcs, types, etc.  panes arranged as Voronoi diagram, each pane with a center point and a relative size

before releasing:
- handle all errors
  - including reader.go parsing errors?
