TODO

- consider the matter of addressability and copying.  currently, there is one variable per input, plus one variable for each connection that exits a block.  there should be a clear rule for when a copy is made so that it is obvious which connections refer to the same value.
- fix bug in indexNode and loopNode:  crash when changing/deleting input connection (something to do with outputs changing)?  might have to do with trying to connect the input to the 2nd inputsNode output, which disappears before the connection is made.
- fix typeView bug(s):
  - type T big.Int, e.g.,  shows up as the struct{} that big.Int is
- browser shows unexported types and struct fields
- in browser, by default don't show non-Go dirs; toggle visibility with a key
- browser bug:  right arrow two levels deep, left arrow to root, scroll up or down several items; everything disappears
- prefix names with pkg name in browser and typeView
- handle funcs with an unconnected input whose type must be named to make a zero value (i.e., is ArrayType or StructType):  import package or, if it is an unexported type, complain and don't write files.
- stabilize file format so that textual diffs only show relevant changes:
  - order of imports (alphabetical).
  - node order? pro: deterministic build, stable files; con: hides bugs
  - variable names (also seqIDs)
- typechecking cgo files somehow works by including an empty "C" package in pkgs map; perhaps find out why.  a better way might be to run 'go tool cgo' on cgo files?
- color conns by type.  hash type name, interpret as color.  or, use multiple colors to describe the whole type tree (outlined, woven, etc).
- improve valueView editing; currently, name and type can't be edited separately.  solution:  allow to focus name text.
- fix connection drawing during mouse editing
- find a better way to embed font (current using something like https://github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata, https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/golang-nuts/UOIUyn7uFsY/Uescy-cI7hQJ) (best to wait for this https://code.google.com/p/go/issues/detail?id=3035).  Or consider installing it in a fixed location (OS X: in app bundle.  Linux: in /usr/share?  Windows: in application directory?)  Also check the go src directory in case someone has go-gotten flux?
- constExprView (for array len in typeView and general use in funcNode)

before releasing:
- handle all errors
  - including reader.go parsing errors?
- gofmt


DONE

- automatic arrangment
- pretty blocks, nodes, conns
- funcs:  inputs, outputs
- types, methods
- loops
- allow package name to differ from directory name
