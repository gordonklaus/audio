Flux requires the GLFW3 (http://glfw.org/) and FTGL (http://sourceforge.net/projects/ftgl/) libraries and header files.  If your system has a package manager, you can use it to install libglfw3-dev and libftgl-dev, if they are available.  Otherwise, you must build and install them from source:  FTGL requires FreeType (http://freetype.org/); install both libraries using the standard "./configure && make && sudo make install" commands.  On Linux, GLFW3 requires the xorg-dev and libglu1-mesa-dev packages.  To build GLFW3 you need CMake (http://cmake.org/).  Configure GLFW3 with the BUILD_SHARED_LIBS option: run "cmake -D BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=true . && make && sudo make install".

Once you have GLFW3 and FTGL, you can build, install, and run Flux as you would any other Go program, e.g., "go install code.google.com/p/gordon-go/flux".
