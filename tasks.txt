- don't limit note and control point times to >0.  let pattern and note be "anchored" at t=0:  placement in score and pattern and movement on grid is based on this anchor while the actual start can be t<0.
- Score

- experiment with Doppler effect with many (esp ambient) sound sources
- approach and exceed the speed of sound in Doppler experiments
- wandering windchimes:  randomly walking pitches (tending towards harmony).  evolving chime spectrum; harmony based on spectrum (Ã  la Sethares)
- perfect circling fifths/fourths/thirds/whathaveyou
- water/air cycle: start with low/mid harmonies (ground air), slowly increase distortion (sun's heat) to add higher spectral components (rising air), reverberate highest components into a smooth noise (clouds), resonate oscillators with falling pitch (rain), repeat
