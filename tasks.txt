- link time translation and scaling between score and pattern.
- don't limit note and control point times to >0.  let pattern and note be "anchored" at t=0:  placement in score and pattern and movement on grid is based on this anchor while the actual start can be t<0.
- pick a nicer font, e.g. http://www.marksimonson.com/fonts/view/anonymous-pro, https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro, or http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/alegreya

- experiment with Doppler effect with many (esp ambient) sound sources
- approach and exceed the speed of sound in Doppler experiments
- wandering windchimes:  randomly walking pitches (tending towards harmony).  evolving chime spectrum; harmony based on spectrum (Ã  la Sethares)
- perfect circling fifths/fourths/thirds/whathaveyou
- water/air cycle: start with low/mid harmonies (ground air), slowly increase distortion (sun's heat) to add higher spectral components (rising air), reverberate highest components into a smooth noise (clouds), resonate oscillators with falling pitch (rain), repeat
- feedback FM:  modulate sine frequency using delayed signal of self
- do some long recordings, e.g., of the forest at night, of the city, of a trip, etc., and play them back time compressed (variable rates, scanning for effect) using granular synthesis
- String instrument, pitch modulated by tension control, stiffness as a parameter, with multiple Play functions:  bow, pluck, mute.  As a 3d source, vibrations from different positions along the string propagate along different paths to the ear.
